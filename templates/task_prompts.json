  "CONTEXT": "Suppose you are a specialist with existing knowledge about a signaling and metabolic molecules and their relations organized into biological pathways and processes.\n",
  "TASK_1": "Given premises marked with the letter P and the following number and the conclusion marked with the letter C, determine whether the conclusion logically follows from these premises. If the conclusion logically follows from the premises, you need to return 'True'. If the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises, you need to return 'False'. The output should be a single word <True> or <False>.{examples}\n\n{question}",
  "TASK_2": "Given premises marked with the letter P and the following number and the conclusion marked with the letter C, determine whether the conclusion logically follows from these premises. If the conclusion logically follows from the premises, you need to return 'True'. If the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises, you need to return 'False'. Specify the premises you used to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and only these premises. The output should be a single word <True> or <False> and the numbers of the selected premises after the decimal point, like <True, P1, P3, P4>.{examples}\n\n{question}",
  "TASK_3": "Given premises marked with the letter P and the following number and the conclusion marked with the letter C, generate a masked premise that will make the conclusion logically follow from these premises. The output should be a single sentence.\n\n{question}",
